# To-do-list
The To-Do List application is a practical and user-friendly web tool created through the collaboration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This simple yet effective application provides users with a streamlined way to organize and manage their tasks. The HTML structure forms the foundation, defining the layout that comprises a list of tasks and interactive elements.

CSS is employed to style the To-Do List, enhancing its visual appeal and creating an intuitive and responsive design. The styling ensures that the user interface is clean, organized, and visually pleasing, making it easy for users to interact with the application.

JavaScript plays a key role in the functionality of the To-Do List. It enables dynamic features such as adding new tasks, marking tasks as complete, and removing tasks from the list. JavaScript also facilitates real-time updates, allowing users to interact with the list seamlessly without the need for page reloads.
